# ctftoolkit

There is nothing particularly special about this script. It just installs several tools that I have found useful for CTF challenges. It is in a very alpha release state at the moment but I am looking to make it a lot more streamline as I improve it and add more tools.

I will eventually put a complete breakdown of what it installs within this README. It should be fairly obvious by just looking at the CTFInstallScript.sh file.

## Install ##

- Clone to a clean kali install
- Make the script executable

chmod +x CTFInstallScript.sh

- Run the install script (requires sudo)

sudo ./CTFInstallScript.sh
